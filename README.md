# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction — Machine Learning + Streamlit

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
👉 https://heart-disease-predictor-rmn8dpvn3rkmu7w4sfgxio.streamlit.app/

This project is an end-to-end **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Streamlit**.  
It includes complete **EDA**, **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and a fully deployed **interactive web app** that predicts heart disease using multiple ML models.

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Performed using:
- pandas, numpy  
- plotly (interactive visualizations)  
- seaborn & matplotlib  
Includes:
- Data overview  
- Summary statistics  
- Missing values check  
- Duplicate removal  
- Distribution plots   

---

### **2️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
Your notebook includes:
- **KNN Imputation** for missing values  
- Train-test split  

---

### **3️⃣ Machine Learning Models**
You trained and compared the following classifiers:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Model comparison  

---

### **4️⃣ Saving Models**
Trained models were saved using Pickle:



🚀 Streamlit Web Application

The Streamlit app (app.py) includes:

✔ UI for taking user health inputs
✔ Converts categorical values to numeric automatically
✔ Loads all three ML models (pickle)
✔ Predicts heart disease in real-time
✔ Adds animations:

🎈 Balloons if no heart disease detected

❄ Snow if heart disease is detected
✔ Fast, responsive deployment on Streamlit Cloud
